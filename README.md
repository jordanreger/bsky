A monorepo with all of my [Bluesky](https://bsky.social)-related projects in it. Notably, [HTMLsky](#htmlsky) is located here.

# [api](https://pkg.go.dev/jordanreger.com/bsky/api)

This library is particularly useful if you're trying to build simple Bluesky applications without having to deal with Bluesky's indigo library.

# [util](https://pkg.go.dev/jordanreger.com/bsky/util)

This library is useful for converting simple things like DIDs, AT URIs, and more.

# htmlsky

HTMLsky is an HTML-only Bluesky frontend.

Just replace [bsky.app](https://bsky.app) with [htmlsky.app](https://htmlsky.app)!
